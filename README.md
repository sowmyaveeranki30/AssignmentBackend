# crud_backend_JSON

# Explanation of Application 

Backend of the application consists of Controllers, Service, Routes and Json files.

The request and response files are provided and modified in the controller file based on the input entered into the app.
Data from JSON is synced in the Services file; read the synced file and parse it.
The battery count has been updated in the router file.
Routes and JSON are utilized in the index file.

The input request and response are captured in a JSON file and stored in a datapath in the backend of this application. The count, the request, and the expected output are updated whenever there is a change in the input.
